        <p>
          On this eventful day of launching our website, we find ourselves amidst the preparations for our sixth-semester exams.

        <h2>What we did yet ?</h2>
        <p>As a group of friends, we had an incredible time enjoying the various facilities provided by our college, H.R.P.G College. We engaged in a wide range of activities, including throwing javelin, playing carom and badminton, working out in the gymnasium, and programming in the new computer lab. From the moment we took admission until we obtained our bachelor's degrees in computer applications, we immersed ourselves in learning a plethora of programming languages such as C, C++, SQL, PL/SQL, Java, C#, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We also gained proficiency in utilizing numerous software and delved deep into studying computers. Through programming, we had the opportunity to design cars, kites, and even animations. Additionally, we acquired knowledge about the Linux operating system, which is widely used by companies like Google and Facebook. Our studies included understanding how microprocessors operate on data, among many other fascinating subjects.
